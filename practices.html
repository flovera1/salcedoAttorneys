									  		<b>Managing Complexities. Maximizing Opportunities.</b><br>
									  		Business mergers and acquisitions can be extremely complicated matters, even when undertaken<br>
									  		within one jurisdiction. When international laws are involved, things can become geometrically more<br>
									  		complex. In order to gain the full benefit of major international business opportunities and to avoid<br>
									  		serious risks, having the help of experienced legal counsel is essential.<br>
									  		The law firm of Salcedo Attorneys at Law P.A. regularly represents multinationals acquiring<br>
									  		businesses and expanding operations in the state of Florida; we also assist U.S.-based corporations<br>
									  		acquiring and expanding their presence in the Latin American region. Our clients are engaged in<br>
									  		numerous industries, including food and beverage, energy, banking, money services, international<br>
									  		courier services and real estate.<br><br>

									  		<b>Comprehensive Services for Business</b>
									  		Our team of <i>attorneys</i> covers a range of specialty areas relevant to mergers and acquisitions in<br> Latin American markets. As a provider of comprehensive legal services, our M&A capabilities include:<br>
									  		• Exploration of acquisition opportunities and risk assessment in context.<br>

									  		• Management of essential regulatory and licensing matters.<br><br>
									  		<b>Due Diligence</b><br>
									  		Performing due diligence prior to a stock or asset purchase requires more than reviewing key legal<br>
									  		elements and potential liabilities of the targeted business. It requires a deep understanding of the<br>
									  		business culture and environment in which the business operates.<br><br>
									  		Salcedo specializes in performing due diligence in those markets where we have a significant<br>
									  		presence and understanding of the business culture. Having our headquarters in Miami, Florida, has<br>
									  		allowed us to fully understand how business is transacted in a dynamic multicultural environment,<br>
									  		an environment in which many of the key players come from Hispanic backgrounds but where<br>
									  		investors tend to forget that U.S. federal and state laws still apply. In addition, our presence in<br>
									  		South America has allowed us to serve as a bridge for U.S. corporations targeting Latin<br>
									  		American-based corporations and expanding their business in South America. <br><br>

										  		<b>Complete Representation for Essential Business Matters.</b>
										  		<br>
										  		For many businesses, maintaining full-time in-house counsel is not practical, particularly for their<br>

										  		choosing outsourced general counsel as a solution.<br>
										  		Salcedo serves as general counsel to businesses and American divisions of foreign corporations,<br>
										  		engaging our network of specialized attorneys in the U.S. and throughout Latin America to help our<br>
										  		clients protect their interests.<br><br>
